    <p>
      Glazed carrots coated in a mixture of brown sugar and butter are a
      versatile side dish you can serve alongside a weeknight meatloaf, a Sunday
      ham, or your Thanksgiving turkey. These caramelized carrots are a definite
      kid-pleaser but they're elegant enough to impress the adults as well!
